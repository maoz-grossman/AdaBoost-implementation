Ariel University
Machine Learning
Homework: AdaBoost

<p>
  In this homework you will implement AdaBoost. We will use the HC Temperature data set
found on the courseâ€™s webpage. It contains 130 data points. The label (1 and -1) will be the
gender, and the temperature and heartrate define the 2-dimensional point.
