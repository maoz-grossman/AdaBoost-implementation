# AdaBoost-implementation
## Implementation of an adaboost algorithm on the dataset  HC_Body_Temperature

<h4>Ariel University</h4>
<h5>Machine Learning</h5>
<h5>Homework: AdaBoost</h5>

<p>
  In this homework you will implement AdaBoost.<br>
  We will use the HC Temperature data set found on the courseâ€™s webpage.
  It contains 130 data points. The label (1 and -1) will be the gender,
  and the temperature and heartrate define the 2-dimensional point.
